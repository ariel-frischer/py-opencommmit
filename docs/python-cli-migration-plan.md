# Python CLI Migration Plan

Your job is to create a mirror python repository in src/python that does most things this repository does.
Do not remove any original js or ts files. For now we will just be editing python code in src/python/ directory.
We have some work already converted but not all lets make sure the basics are working first.
We have some basics set up but will need to convert each js or ts file into python one by one.
Ask the expert frequently for any difficult issues or high level planning.
We do not need to support any github action logic. We only need to support openai provider for now.
Once you are done with most of the work create a new PYTHON-README.md with usage instructions for running the python version.

## CLI Structure
- Replace Node.js shebang with Python shebang
- Mirror existing CLI command structure
- Use Click or Typer for CLI framework

## LiteLLM Integration
- Centralize LLM API calls via LiteLLM Proxy
- Configure via environment variables
- Disable unnecessary logging for production

## UV Usage
- Use UV for dependency management
- Integrate with pyproject.toml
- Ensure compatibility with pip and pip-tools

## Tooling Recommendations
- Use Pipx for system-wide installation
- Implement automated testing with pytest
- Add type checking with mypy
- Include linting via ruff
